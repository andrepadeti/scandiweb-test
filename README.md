# Minimalistic Storefront

This is a very simple storefront I built in React. It uses libraries such as [**react-router-dom**](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start), [**apollo-client**](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) and [**React Context**](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html). I also took the opportunity to practice using React Class Components. 

to run:
```sh
yarn
yarn start
```
