### Entry React developer test

Hi! Thanks for the opportunity to take part in the test. There are plenty of things I have learned so far, most noticeably the use of libraries such as [**react-router-dom**](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start), [**apollo-client**](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) and [**React Context**](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) within Class Components. 

to run:
```sh
yarn
yarn start
```

I am looking forward to knowing what you think about my app!
